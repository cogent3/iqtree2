# IQ-TREE Development Docker Container

This folder contains the Docker configuration files for setting up a development environment for the IQ-TREE project.

## Prerequisites

Docker must be installed on your system. You can download Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).  Alternatively, on macOS, you can use Colima. See the section below for instructions on installing Colima.

## Installing Colima on macOS

Colima is a tool that provides a lightweight Docker-compatible environment on macOS without the need for a hypervisor. It is an alternative to Docker Desktop.

1. Install Colima using Homebrew:

    ```sh
    brew install colima
    ```

2. Initialize Colima with the Docker runtime:

    ```sh
    colima start --runtime docker
    ```

3. Verify that Colima is running:

    ```sh
    colima status
    ```

Now you can use Docker commands as you normally would, and Colima will handle the container runtime on macOS.

## Docker Image Contents

This container downloads and installs the following dependencies:

- Eigen library: Used for linear algebra.
- TERRAPHAST library: Used for computing the likelihood of a tree.
- Boost libraries: Used for various utility functions and data structures.
- zlib: Compression library.
- libbz2: Library for high-quality data compression.
- liblzma: Compression library.
- TBB (Threading Building Blocks): Used for parallel programming.
- Google Performance Tools: Contains TCMalloc, heap-checker, heap-profiler, and cpu-profiler.
- OpenMPI: Message Passing Interface library for parallel programming.
- libpll: Library for phylogenetic analysis.
- Clang: C language family frontend for LLVM.
- CMake: Cross-platform build system.
- Git: Distributed version control system.
- wget: Network utility to retrieve files from the web.
- plf_nanotimer: A high-resolution, cross-platform timer library for precise time measurement in nanoseconds.
- plf_colony: A container library optimized for frequent insertions and erasures while maintaining cache-friendliness and iterator stability.


## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the root of the repository and run the following command to build a docker image named `iqtree-dev` using the Dockerfile in the `docker` directory:

`docker build -t iqtree2-dev -f docker/Dockerfile .`

## Running the Docker Container

To start a Docker container using the image you just built and run iqtree interactively in a terminal session, run the following command:

`docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/app iqtree2-dev`

This command does the following:

- `run`: Runs a command in a new container.
- `-it`: Allocates a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin and stdout.
- `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it exits.
- `-v $(pwd):/usr/src/app`: Mounts the current directory on the host to `/usr/src/app` in the container.
- `iqtree-dev`: The name of the image to use.

## Configuring the container for debugging using Xcode

To configure the container for debugging using Xcode, run the following command instead:

`docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app -p 1234:1234 -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 iqtree-dev`

...
- `-p 1234:1234`: Maps port 1234 on the host to port 1234 in the container to allow Xcode debuugging.
- `-e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0`: Specifies the X11 display to use will be on the host machine.

## Configuring the container for debugging using VScode

To configure the container for debugging using VScode, run the following command instead:

`docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app -p 3000:3000 iqtree-dev`

...
- `-p 3000:3000`: Maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container to allow VS Code debugging.

## Inside the Docker Container

Once inside the Docker container, you will be in the `/usr/src/app` directory where you can find the IQ-TREE 2 project files. You can perform git operations, build the project, and run tests as you would in a regular development environment.

## Exiting the Docker Container

To exit the Docker container, simply type `exit` and press `Enter`.

## Cleaning Up

To remove the Docker image you created, first find the image ID using:

`docker images`

Then, remove the image using:

`docker rmi <image_id>`

Replace `<IMAGE_ID>` with the ID of the image you want to remove.
